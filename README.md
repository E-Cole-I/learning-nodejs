# NodeJS Projects

This is a archive for my early NodeJS projects to build upon my skills. These projects will hopefully increase in complpexity and usefulness. 

### Project 1

Simple webserver and website using NodeJS. This was my first step into node after coding a webserver with Python and sockets library. I found NodeJS to make things a lot easier, and coding in JavaScript was a lot of fun. 


### Project 2

Webserver, website, and database connection using NodeJS, Express, Express Session, and MySQL. This project was cool to understand how the frontend part of the system needs to interact with the backend including a relational database. I played around with creating user login validation with the database, and maintaining that session until the specific user logged out. In this project the user could add items to a schedule which would be dynamically populated when new events were added. 


### Project 3

GeoJson WebServer and Website using NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, and Leaflet. Coming from the spatial side of things, I thought it would be great to create a webserver than serves GeoJson data to a web map based on user queries. I used MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database, for the backend database which made querying a little bit weird compared to relational databases. This is still a work in progress, and more updates will come to this project.
